# Plotly for effective data visualization

This guide focuses on a couple of key aspects, not much mentioned in data visualizations: 1). Writing more concise and readable code 2). Automation easily taking into account new data.

The current blog sheds some light on how to do this in Plotly, giving first examples where the code needs to be tuned manually, and second giving a better example where it is more concise and automated. For this purpose we use a simple example of weather data in Switzerland.
